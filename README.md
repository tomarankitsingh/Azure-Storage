# Azure-Storage-Account-Project

## Overview
The project focuses on managing files within an Azure Storage Account, where specific access permissions are established for users. The main objectives include allowing an anonymous user to upload files to a container using a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token, while also ensuring the admin is alerted upon any file uploads or changes made by users. Additionally, access controls and monitoring are configured to secure the storage account and track user activities effectively.

# As an Administrator -----  u have to -
1. Upload a sample internship letter to a private container within the Azure Storage Account.
2. Grant access to the container for a designated user.
3. Configure alerts to notify the administrator whenever a new file is uploaded to the container.

# As an User -----  u have to -
- Access the internship letter, digitally sign it, and upload the signed document back to the container.
